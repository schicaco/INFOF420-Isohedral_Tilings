        <h1>Isohedral Tilings & Folding Tiles</h1>
    </header>

        <section id="theory">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project explores isohedral tilings, focusing on algorithms that identify and transform specific tile types based on their symmetry properties. Isohedral tilings, where identical shapes tile the plane repetitively, have significant applications in fields such as materials science, art, and mathematics.</p>
            <p>The project has two main objectives:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Detecting Isohedral Tiles with Rotational Symmetries:</strong> Develop algorithms to identify tiles with 3-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold rotational symmetries.</li>
                <li><strong>Folding Tiles into Doubly-Covered Triangles:</strong> Transform identified tiles into simpler shapes—doubly-covered triangles—while preserving symmetry, allowing for new tiling configurations.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Detecting Isohedral Tiles with Rotational Symmetries</h2>
            <p>We focus on identifying isohedral tiles characterized by 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetries. The specific polygons considered are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polyiamonds:</strong> Built from equilateral triangles, exhibiting 3-fold rotational symmetry.</li>
                <li><strong>Polyominoes:</strong> Composed of squares, displaying 4-fold rotational symmetry.</li>
                <li><strong>Polyhexes:</strong> Made from regular hexagons, allowing for 3-fold and 6-fold rotational symmetries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>

            <h4>Tile</h4>
            <p>A <strong>tile</strong> is a shape or geometric figure used in the process of tiling a plane or surface. Tiling (or tessellation) involves covering a surface entirely with copies of one or more tiles without any gaps or overlaps.</p>

            <h4>Isohedral Tile</h4>
            <p>An <strong>isohedral tile</strong> is a shape that can tile the plane such that every tile in the tiling is identical in shape and size, and each one can be mapped onto any other by a symmetry of the tiling. This property is also referred to as transitivity, meaning the tiling pattern exhibits uniformity, as each tile looks indistinguishable in its position relative to others in the tiling.</p>

            

            <h4>Symmetry</h4>
            <p><strong>Symmetry</strong> in mathematics refers to a transformation that leaves an object looking the same after it has been applied. For tilings, symmetries include rotations, reflections, and translations that map the tiling onto itself.</p>

            <h4>Palindrome</h4>
            <p>A <strong>palindrome</strong> is a word or sequence that reads the same forward and backward. In the context of boundary words, a palindrome indicates reflective symmetry along an axis.</p>

            <h4>k-Drome</h4>
            <p>A <strong>k-drome</strong> is a generalization of palindromes for rotational symmetries. It is a word that is symmetric under rotation by an angle <strong>k</strong> degrees.</p>
            <p>For example, a <strong>90-drome</strong> is a word where each character maps to its counterpart under a 90-degree rotation.</p>

            <h4>Quarter-Turn Factorization</h4>
            <p>A <strong>quarter-turn factorization</strong> of a boundary word <strong>W</strong> is a factorization of the form <strong>W = ABC</strong>, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong> is a palindrome.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are 90-dromes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This factorization helps identify 4-fold rotational symmetries in polyominoes.</p>

            <h3>Quarter-Turn Factorization in Boundary Words</h3>

            <p>In the study of polyominoes and their tiling properties, understanding the symmetries of their boundary words is crucial. This section provides a comprehensive explanation of an algorithm for detecting quarter-turn factorizations in boundary words of polyominoes. We will define key concepts, present important lemmas with proofs, and explain the algorithm in a didactic manner, ensuring clarity and accessibility.</p>

            <h4>Definitions</h4>

            <h5>Polyomino and Boundary Word</h5>

            <p>A <strong>polyomino</strong> is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge.</p>

            <p>The <strong>boundary word</strong> of a polyomino, denoted by <strong>W</strong>, is the sequence of directions taken when traversing the perimeter of the polyomino in a specified direction (usually clockwise). The boundary word is composed of the letters representing the four cardinal directions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>E</strong> (East)</li>
                <li><strong>N</strong> (North)</li>
                <li><strong>W</strong> (West)</li>
                <li><strong>S</strong> (South)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>[Illustration of a polyomino and its boundary word]</em></p>

            <h5>Palindrome</h5>

            <p>A <strong>palindrome</strong> is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards.</p>
            <p><strong>Formally</strong>: A word <strong>W</strong> of length <strong>n</strong> is a palindrome if <strong>W[i] = W[n - i + 1]</strong> for all <strong>i</strong> from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>n</strong>.</p>

            <h5>90-Drome</h5>

            <p>A <strong>90-drome</strong> is a word that is symmetric under a 90-degree rotation.</p>

            <h6>Rotation Function \( t_{90} \)</h6>

            <p>The rotation function <strong>t<sub>90</sub></strong> maps each direction to the direction obtained by rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>t<sub>90</sub>(E) = N</strong></li>
                <li><strong>t<sub>90</sub>(N) = W</strong></li>
                <li><strong>t<sub>90</sub>(W) = S</strong></li>
                <li><strong>t<sub>90</sub>(S) = E</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Definition</strong>: A word <strong>W</strong> is a 90-drome if for all positions <strong>i</strong>:</p>
            <p><strong>W[i] = t<sub>90</sub>(W[|W| - i + 1])</strong></p>
            <p>That is, each character is the 90-degree rotation of its symmetric counterpart.</p>

            <h5>Quarter-Turn Factorization</h5>

            <p>A <strong>quarter-turn factorization</strong> of a boundary word <strong>W</strong> has the form <strong>W = ABC</strong>, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong> is a palindrome.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are 90-dromes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This factorization allows us to identify and utilize the 4-fold rotational symmetry in the tiling of polyominoes.</p>

            <p><em>[Illustration of a boundary word factorized into A (palindrome), B and C (90-dromes)]</em></p>

            <h4>Lemmas and Proofs</h4>

            <p>To understand and develop the algorithm for detecting quarter-turn factorizations, we rely on several important lemmas. These lemmas help establish the properties of palindromes and 90-dromes within boundary words.</p>

            <!-- Lemma 1 -->
            <h5>Lemma 1: Length of 90-Drome in a Periodic Word</h5>

            <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> Let <strong>W</strong> be a word with a period of length <strong>p</strong>, and <strong>X</strong> a 90-drome subword of <strong>W</strong>. Then <strong>|X| ≤ p</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a word that repeats every <strong>p</strong> characters, any 90-drome within it cannot be longer than <strong>p</strong>. This is because the symmetry imposed by the 90-drome cannot extend beyond the repeating pattern of the word.</p>

            <p><strong>Proof Sketch:</strong> Assume, for contradiction, that <strong>|X| > p</strong>. Then, due to the periodicity of <strong>W</strong> and the symmetry of <strong>X</strong>, we encounter conflicting conditions on the characters of <strong>X</strong>, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, <strong>|X| ≤ p</strong>.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for Detailed Proof -->

            <!-- Lemma 2 -->
            <h5>Lemma 2: Length Limit of Non-Overlapping 90-Dromes</h5>

            <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> Let <strong>W</strong> be a word. Let <strong>P</strong> be a prefix and <strong>S</strong> be a suffix of <strong>W</strong>, both being 90-dromes with <strong>|P|, |S| ≥ (2/3)|W|</strong>. Then any other 90-drome factor of <strong>W</strong> not sharing the center with <strong>P</strong> or <strong>S</strong> has length less than <strong>2|W| - (|P| + |S|)</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma limits the length of any additional 90-drome in <strong>W</strong> that doesn't overlap with the centers of <strong>P</strong> or <strong>S</strong>. Essentially, large 90-dromes consume much of the word's length, restricting the size of other non-overlapping 90-dromes.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for Detailed Proof -->

            <!-- Lemma 3 -->
            <h5>Lemma 3: Upper Bound on Shorter 90-Drome</h5>

            <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> Let <strong>W</strong> be a word. Let <strong>P</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> be prefixes of <strong>W</strong>, both being 90-dromes, with <strong>|P| < |Q| < |W|</strong>. Then <strong>|P| < (2/3)|W|</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> If there are two 90-drome prefixes with different lengths, the shorter one cannot be too long. This is due to the limitations imposed by the presence of the longer 90-drome on the structure of the word.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for Detailed Proof -->

            <!-- Lemma 4 -->
            <h5>Lemma 4: Finite Number of Long 90-Dromes</h5>

            <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> Let <strong>W</strong> be a boundary word. There exist <strong>O(1)</strong> admissible 90-drome factors of <strong>W</strong> with length at least <strong>|W| / 3</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma states that only a constant number of long 90-dromes can exist in <strong>W</strong>. This is important for the efficiency of our algorithm, as it limits the number of candidates we need to consider.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for Detailed Proof -->

            <!-- Lemma 5 -->
            <h5>Lemma 5: Periodicity from Long Palindromes</h5>

            <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> Let <strong>W</strong> be a word. Let <strong>P</strong> be a prefix and <strong>S</strong> be a suffix of <strong>W</strong>, both being palindromes with <strong>|P|, |S| ≥ (2/3)|W|</strong>, and <strong>P ≠ S</strong>. Then <strong>W</strong> has a period of length <strong>2|W| - (|P| + |S|)</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The overlapping structure of long palindromic prefixes and suffixes imposes a periodic pattern on the word <strong>W</strong>.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for Detailed Proof -->

            <!-- Lemma 6 -->
            <h5>Lemma 6: Length Limit of Middle Palindromes</h5>

            <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> Under the same conditions as Lemma 5, any admissible middle palindrome of <strong>W</strong> has length at most <strong>2|W| - (|P| + |S|)</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Middle palindromes not overlapping with the long palindromic prefix or suffix must be short due to the periodicity imposed by the longer palindromes.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for Detailed Proof -->

            <!-- Lemma 7 -->
            <h5>Lemma 7: Small Set of Factors Covering Long Palindromes</h5>

            <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> There exists an <strong>O(1)</strong>-sized set <strong>F</strong> of factors of <strong>W</strong> such that every admissible palindrome factor with length at least <strong>|W| / 3</strong> is an affix (prefix or suffix) of an element of <strong>F</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> All long palindromic factors are associated with a small, computable set. This allows us to efficiently identify and consider all significant palindromic factors.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for Detailed Proof -->

            <!-- Lemma 8 -->
            <h5>Lemma 8: Admissibility in Quarter-Turn Factorization</h5>

            <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> In a boundary word <strong>W = ABC</strong> with <strong>A</strong> a palindrome and <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong> being 90-dromes, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong> are admissible.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma confirms that the factors in the quarter-turn factorization meet the necessary conditions to be considered palindromes and 90-dromes within the boundary word.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for Detailed Proof -->

            <h4>The Algorithm</h4>

            <h5>Theorem: Linear-Time Detection of Quarter-Turn Factorization</h5>

            <p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Given a polyomino <strong>P</strong> with boundary word <strong>W</strong> of length <strong>n</strong>, we can decide in <strong>O(n)</strong> time whether <strong>W</strong> has a quarter-turn factorization.</p>

            <h5>Algorithm Steps</h5>

            <h6>Step 1: Preprocessing</h6>

            <p>Compute all admissible palindromic factors of <strong>W</strong> using Manacher's algorithm, which operates in <strong>O(n)</strong> time. Similarly, compute all admissible 90-drome factors by adapting the approach for rotational symmetry.</p>

            <h6>Step 2: Identifying Long Factors</h6>

            <p>Using Lemmas 4 and 7, identify the <strong>O(1)</strong> long admissible palindromic and 90-drome factors (those with length at least <strong>|W| / 3</strong>).</p>

            <h6>Step 3: Generating Candidate Factorizations</h6>

            <p>For each long factor, generate candidate factorizations <strong>W = ABC</strong> where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong> is a palindrome.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are 90-dromes.</li>
                <li>The factors fit together to form the entire word <strong>W</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Step 4: Verification</h6>

            <p>For each candidate factorization, verify the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong> is indeed a palindrome (check using preprocessed data).</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are 90-dromes (also check using preprocessed data).</li>
                <li>The concatenation <strong>ABC</strong> equals the original boundary word <strong>W</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Step 5: Conclusion</h6>

            <p>If a valid factorization is found, the boundary word <strong>W</strong> has a quarter-turn factorization, indicating that the polyomino exhibits 4-fold rotational symmetry and can tile the plane isohedrally under that symmetry.</p>

            <h5>Time Complexity Analysis</h5>

            <p>The algorithm operates in linear time relative to the length of the boundary word (<strong>O(n)</strong>). Here's the breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> <strong>O(n)</strong> time.</li>
                <li><strong>Identifying Long Factors:</strong> Since there are only <strong>O(1)</strong> long factors, this step is constant time.</li>
                <li><strong>Generating Candidates:</strong> With a constant number of long factors, we have a constant number of candidate factorizations to consider.</li>
                <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Each verification step takes <strong>O(1)</strong> time using preprocessed data.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Time:</strong> <strong>O(n)</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Folding Tiles into Doubly-Covered Triangles</h2>
            <p>In this phase, we explore how the identified isohedral tiles can be folded into simpler shapes, specifically doubly-covered triangles. This process involves manipulating the tiles to overlap parts of themselves, forming new shapes that can still tile the plane.</p>

            <h3>Doubly-Covered Triangle</h3>
            <p>A <strong>doubly-covered triangle</strong> is a configuration where two identical triangular shapes are overlaid on top of one another, typically formed by folding a tile.</p>

            <h3>Folding Algorithm</h3>
            <p>The algorithm for folding involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identifying fold lines:</strong> Determine where the tile can be folded without cutting.</li>
                <li><strong>Executing the fold:</strong> Manipulate the tile along the fold lines to create overlapping regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Verifying tiling capability:</strong> Ensure that the new shape can tile the plane without gaps or overlaps.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <p>Folding tiles into simpler shapes allows for the creation of new tiling patterns and can simplify the analysis of tiling capabilities. It also has implications in materials science for designing foldable structures.</p>

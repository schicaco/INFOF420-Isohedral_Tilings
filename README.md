# INFO-F420 Project: Isohedral Tilings & Folding Tiles

## Project Overview

This project is part of the INFO-F420 course and is focused on the study of isohedral tilings, specifically investigating the detection of isohedral tiles with rotational symmetries and exploring their folding properties. The project consists of two main phases:

1. **Detecting Isohedral Tiles with Rotational Symmetries**
2. **Folding Tiles into a Doubly-Covered Triangle**
3. 
## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the web interface.
- **CSS** for styling the project.
- **JavaScript** for implementing the logic of detecting isohedral tiles and folding operations.
- **Node.js** with **npm** for managing dependencies.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/schicaco/INFOF420-Isohedral_Tilings.git
   ```

2.	Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd infof420-project
    ```


3.	Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```


4.	Open the project in a browser:

    ```bash
    npm start

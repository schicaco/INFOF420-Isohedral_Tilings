# INFO-F420 Project: Isohedral Tilings & Folding Tiles

## Project Overview

This project is part of the INFO-F420 course and is focused on the study of isohedral tilings, specifically investigating the detection of isohedral tiles with rotational symmetries and exploring their folding properties. The project consists of two main phases:

1. **Detecting Isohedral Tiles with Rotational Symmetries**
2. **Folding Tiles into a Doubly-Covered Triangle**

## Deployment

The project is hosted online and accessible via the following link:

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the web interface.
- **CSS** for styling the project.
- **JavaScript** for implementing the logic of detecting isohedral tiles and folding operations.
- **Node.js** with **npm** for managing dependencies.

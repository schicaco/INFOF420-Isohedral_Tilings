        <h1>Isohedral Tilings & Folding Tiles</h1>
    </header>

        <section id="theory">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project explores isohedral tilings, focusing on algorithms that identify and transform specific tile types based on their symmetry properties. Isohedral tilings, where identical shapes tile the plane repetitively, have significant applications in fields such as materials science, art, and mathematics.</p>
            <p>The project has two main objectives:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Detecting Isohedral Tiles with Rotational Symmetries:</strong> Develop algorithms to identify tiles with 3-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold rotational symmetries.</li>
                <li><strong>Folding Tiles into Doubly-Covered Triangles:</strong> Transform identified tiles into simpler shapes—doubly-covered triangles—while preserving symmetry, allowing for new tiling configurations.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Detecting Isohedral Tiles with Rotational Symmetries</h2>
            <p>We focus on identifying isohedral tiles characterized by 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetries. The specific polygons considered are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polyiamonds:</strong> Built from equilateral triangles, exhibiting 3-fold rotational symmetry.</li>
                <li><strong>Polyominoes:</strong> Composed of squares, displaying 4-fold rotational symmetry.</li>
                <li><strong>Polyhexes:</strong> Made from regular hexagons, allowing for 3-fold and 6-fold rotational symmetries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Core Concepts</h3>

            <h4>Tile</h4>
            <p>A <strong>tile</strong> is a shape or geometric figure (like a polyomino) used in the process of tiling a plane or surface. Tiling (or tessellation) involves covering a surface entirely with copies of one or more tiles without any gaps or overlaps.</p>
            <p>A <strong>polyomino</strong> is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge.</p>
            <p>A <strong>TODO, polygons</strong></p>

            <h4>Symmetry</h4>
            <p><strong>Symmetry</strong> in mathematics refers to a transformation that leaves an object looking the same after it has been applied. For tilings, symmetries include rotations, reflections, and translations that map the tiling onto itself.</p>
            <p><strong>Example of Symmetry:</strong> A square has 4-fold rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated by 90 degrees and still look the same.</p>

            <h4>Isohedral Tile</h4>
            <p>An <strong>isohedral tile</strong> is a shape that can tile the plane such that every tile in the tiling is identical in shape and size, and each one can be mapped onto any other by a symmetry of the tiling. This property is also referred to as transitivity, meaning the tiling pattern exhibits uniformity, as each tile looks indistinguishable in its position relative to others in the tiling.</p>
            
            <h4>Examples of Tilings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Isohedral Tiling Example:</strong> The regular hexagonal tiling is isohedral because each hexagon is identical and the tiling exhibits 6-fold rotational symmetry.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Isohedral Tiling Example:</strong> The Penrose tiling is not isohedral as it uses two distinct shapes that do not map onto each other via the tiling's symmetries.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Isohedral Tiling with Isohedral Tile:</strong> A tiling composed of regular pentagons and squares is not isohedral, but the squares within the tiling are isohedral tiles on their own.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Boundary Word</h4>
            <p>A <strong>boundary word</strong> is a sequence that represents the directions taken when traversing the perimeter of a tile. For this project, we will read the boundary words starting from the top left corner (an arbitrary choice) and proceed in a clockwise direction. The boundary word is composed of the letters representing the four cardinal directions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>E</strong> (East)</li>
                <li><strong>N</strong> (North)</li>
                <li><strong>W</strong> (West)</li>
                <li><strong>S</strong> (South)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a simple square tile. Starting from the top left corner and moving clockwise, its boundary word could be represented as "EENNWWSS".</p>

            <h5>Period</h5>
            <p>A <strong>period</strong> of a word <strong>W</strong> is the smallest positive integer <strong>p</strong> such that <strong>W[i] = W[i + p]</strong> for all valid <strong>i</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In the word "ababab", the smallest period is 2, since the pattern "ab" repeats.</p>

            <h5>Norm Function</h5>
            <p>The <strong>norm function</strong>, denoted as <strong>||W||</strong>, represents the length of the word <strong>W</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If <strong>W = "ENWS"</strong>, then <strong>||W|| = 4</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Palindrome</h4>
            <p>A <strong>palindrome</strong> is a word or sequence that reads the same forward and backward. In the context of boundary words, a palindrome indicates reflective symmetry along an axis.</p>
            <p><strong>Example of a Palindrome:</strong> The word "EENNEE" is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.</p>
            <p><strong>Formally</strong>: A word <strong>W</strong> of length <strong>n</strong> is a palindrome if <strong>W[i] = W[n - i + 1]</strong> for all <strong>i</strong> from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>n</strong>.</p>

            <h4>k-Drome</h4>
            <p>A <strong>k-drome</strong> is a generalization of palindromes for rotational symmetries. It is a word that is symmetric under rotation by an angle <strong>k</strong> degrees.</p>
            <p>For example, a <strong>90-drome</strong> is a word where each character maps to its counterpart under a 90-degree rotation.</p>
            <p><strong>Example of a 90-drome:</strong> Consider the boundary word "ENWS". Under a 90-degree rotation, 'E' becomes 'N', 'N' becomes 'W', 'W' becomes 'S', and 'S' becomes 'E'. If applying the rotation to each character of "ENWS" reverses the word, then it is a 90-drome.</p>

            <!-- Quarter-Turn Factorization Section -->
            <h3>Quarter-Turn Factorization in Boundary Words</h3>

            <h4>Quarter-Turn Factorization</h4>
            <p>A <strong>quarter-turn factorization</strong> of a boundary word <strong>W</strong> is a factorization of the form <strong>W = ABC</strong>, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong> is a palindrome.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are 90-dromes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This factorization helps identify 4-fold rotational symmetries in polyominoes.</p>

            <!-- Example of Quarter-Turn Factorization -->
            <h5>Example of Quarter-Turn Factorization</h5>
            <p>Consider the boundary word <strong>W = "EENNEEENWSENWS"</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A = "EENNEE"</strong> &mdash; This is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.</li>
                <li><strong>B = "ENWS"</strong> &mdash; This is a 90-drome. Applying the 90-degree rotation:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>t<sub>90</sub>(E) = N</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>t<sub>90</sub>(N) = W</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>t<sub>90</sub>(W) = S</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>t<sub>90</sub>(S) = E</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Reverse <strong>B</strong>: "ENWS" reversed is "SWNE". Applying <strong>t<sub>90</sub></strong> to each character of "SWNE" gives "ENWS", which matches <strong>B</strong>, confirming it is a 90-drome.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>C = "ENWS"</strong> &mdash; Similarly, <strong>C</strong> is a 90-drome by the same reasoning as <strong>B</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Therefore, <strong>W = A + B + C = "EENNEE" + "ENWS" + "ENWS"</strong> is a valid quarter-turn factorization.</p>

            <h4>Definitions</h4>

            <!-- Lemmas and Proofs -->
            <h5>Lemma 1. Let <strong>W</strong> be a word with a period of length <strong>p</strong>, and <strong>X</strong> a 90-drome subword of <strong>W</strong>. Then <strong>|X| ≤ p</strong>.</h5>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a word that repeats every <strong>p</strong> characters, any 90-drome within it cannot be longer than <strong>p</strong>. This is because the symmetry imposed by the 90-drome cannot extend beyond the repeating pattern of the word.</p>
            <p><strong>Proof Sketch:</strong> Assume, for contradiction, that <strong>|X| > p</strong>. Then, due to the periodicity of <strong>W</strong> and the symmetry of <strong>X</strong>, we encounter conflicting conditions on the characters of <strong>X</strong>, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, <strong>|X| ≤ p</strong>.</p>

            <h5>Lemma 2. Let <strong>W</strong> be a word. Let <strong>P</strong> be a prefix and <strong>S</strong> be a suffix of <strong>W</strong>, both being 90-dromes with <strong>|P|, |S| ≥ (2/3)|W|</strong>. Then any other 90-drome factor of <strong>W</strong> not sharing the center with <strong>P</strong> or <strong>S</strong> has length less than <strong>2|W| - (|P| + |S|)</strong>.</h5>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma limits the length of any additional 90-drome in <strong>W</strong> that doesn't overlap with the centers of <strong>P</strong> or <strong>S</strong>. Essentially, large 90-dromes consume much of the word's length, restricting the size of other non-overlapping 90-dromes.</p>

            <h5>Lemma 3. Let <strong>W</strong> be a word. Let <strong>P</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> be prefixes of <strong>W</strong>, both being 90-dromes, with <strong>|P| < |Q| < |W|</strong>. Then <strong>|P| < (2/3)|W|</strong>.</h5>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> If there are two 90-drome prefixes with different lengths, the shorter one cannot be too long. This is due to the limitations imposed by the presence of the longer 90-drome on the structure of the word.</p>

            <h5>Lemma 4. Let <strong>W</strong> be a boundary word. There exist <strong>O(1)</strong> admissible 90-drome factors of <strong>W</strong> with length at least <strong>|W| / 3</strong>.</h5>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma states that only a constant number of long 90-dromes can exist in <strong>W</strong>. This is important for the efficiency of our algorithm, as it limits the number of candidates we need to consider.</p>

            <h5>Lemma 5. Let <strong>W</strong> be a word. Let <strong>P</strong> be a prefix and <strong>S</strong> be a suffix of <strong>W</strong>, both being palindromes with <strong>|P|, |S| ≥ (2/3)|W|</strong>, and <strong>P ≠ S</strong>. Then <strong>W</strong> has a period of length <strong>2|W| - (|P| + |S|)</strong>.</h5>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The overlapping structure of long palindromic prefixes and suffixes imposes a periodic pattern on the word <strong>W</strong>.</p>

            <h5>Lemma 6. Under the same conditions as Lemma 5, any admissible middle palindrome of <strong>W</strong> has length at most <strong>2|W| - (|P| + |S|)</strong>.</h5>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Middle palindromes not overlapping with the long palindromic prefix or suffix must be short due to the periodicity imposed by the longer palindromes.</p>

            <h5>Lemma 7. There exists an <strong>O(1)</strong>-sized set <strong>F</strong> of factors of <strong>W</strong> such that every admissible palindrome factor with length at least <strong>|W| / 3</strong> is an affix (prefix or suffix) of an element of <strong>F</strong>.</h5>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> All long palindromic factors are associated with a small, computable set. This allows us to efficiently identify and consider all significant palindromic factors.</p>

            <h5>Lemma 8. In a boundary word <strong>W = ABC</strong> with <strong>A</strong> a palindrome and <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong> being 90-dromes, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong> are admissible.</h5>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma confirms that the factors in the quarter-turn factorization meet the necessary conditions to be considered palindromes and 90-dromes within the boundary word.</p>

            <h4>The Algorithm</h4>

            <h5>Theorem: Linear-Time Detection of Quarter-Turn Factorization</h5>
            <p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Given a polyomino <strong>P</strong> with boundary word <strong>W</strong> of length <strong>n</strong>, we can decide in <strong>O(n)</strong> time whether <strong>W</strong> has a quarter-turn factorization.</p>

            <h5>Algorithm Steps</h5>

            <h6>Step 1: Preprocessing</h6>
            <p>Compute all admissible palindromic factors of <strong>W</strong> using Manacher's algorithm, which operates in <strong>O(n)</strong> time. Similarly, compute all admissible 90-drome factors by adapting the approach for rotational symmetry.</p>

            <h6>Step 2: Identifying Long Factors</h6>
            <p>Using Lemmas 4 and 7, identify the <strong>O(1)</strong> long admissible palindromic and 90-drome factors (those with length at least <strong>|W| / 3</strong>).</p>

            <h6>Step 3: Generating Candidate Factorizations</h6>
            <p>For each long factor, generate candidate factorizations <strong>W = ABC</strong> where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong> is a palindrome.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are 90-dromes.</li>
                <li>The factors fit together to form the entire word <strong>W</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Step 4: Verification</h6>
            <p>For each candidate factorization, verify the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong> is indeed a palindrome (check using preprocessed data).</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are 90-dromes (also check using preprocessed data).</li>
                <li>The concatenation <strong>ABC</strong> equals the original boundary word <strong>W</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Step 5: Conclusion</h6>
            <p>If a valid factorization is found, the boundary word <strong>W</strong> has a quarter-turn factorization, indicating that the polyomino exhibits 4-fold rotational symmetry and can tile the plane isohedrally under that symmetry.</p>

            <h5>Time Complexity Analysis</h5>
            <p>The algorithm operates in linear time relative to the length of the boundary word (<strong>O(n)</strong>). Here's the breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> <strong>O(n)</strong> time.</li>
                <li><strong>Identifying Long Factors:</strong> Since there are only <strong>O(1)</strong> long factors, this step is constant time.</li>
                <li><strong>Generating Candidates:</strong> With a constant number of long factors, we have a constant number of candidate factorizations to consider.</li>
                <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Each verification step takes <strong>O(1)</strong> time using preprocessed data.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Time:</strong> <strong>O(n)</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Folding Tiles into Doubly-Covered Triangles</h2>
            <p>In this phase, we explore how the identified isohedral tiles can be folded into simpler shapes, specifically doubly-covered triangles. This process involves manipulating the tiles to overlap parts of themselves, forming new shapes that can still tile the plane.</p>

            <h3>Doubly-Covered Triangle</h3>
            <p>A <strong>doubly-covered triangle</strong> is a configuration where two identical triangular shapes are overlaid on top of one another, typically formed by folding a tile.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for Illustration -->
            <p><em>[Illustration of folding a tile into a doubly-covered triangle]</em></p>

            <h3>Folding Algorithm</h3>
            <p>The algorithm for folding involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identifying fold lines:</strong> Determine where the tile can be folded without cutting.</li>
                <li><strong>Executing the fold:</strong> Manipulate the tile along the fold lines to create overlapping regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Verifying tiling capability:</strong> Ensure that the new shape can tile the plane without gaps or overlaps.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <p>Folding tiles into simpler shapes allows for the creation of new tiling patterns and can simplify the analysis of tiling capabilities. It also has implications in materials science for designing foldable structures.</p>

                    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In the world of geometry, tiling refers to the process of covering a surface with a pattern of shapes, called tiles, without gaps or overlaps.
                One fascinating type of tiling is <strong>isohedral tiling</strong>, where all tiles in the pattern are identical in shape. This project delves into
                the study of isohedral tiles, specifically those exhibiting <strong>rotational symmetries</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rotational symmetries are properties that allow a shape to be rotated around a central point without changing its overall appearance. The main focus
                of this project is to develop algorithms that can detect isohedral tiles with specific rotational symmetries, namely <strong>3-fold, 4-fold, and
                6-fold</strong> symmetries. These symmetries are particularly interesting as they allow the tiles to be rotated by certain angles and still match
                the original pattern.

            <h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Tile</h4>
                <p>A <strong>tile</strong> is a shape or geometric figure (like a polyomino) used in the process of tiling a plane or surface. Tiling (or tessellation) involves covering a surface entirely with copies of one or more tiles without any gaps or overlaps.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Isohedral Tile</h4>
                <p>An <strong>isohedral tile</strong> is a shape that can tile the plane such that every tile in the tiling is identical in shape and size, and each one can be mapped onto any other by a symmetry of the tiling. This property is also referred to as transitivity, meaning the tiling pattern exhibits uniformity, as each tile looks indistinguishable in its position relative to others in the tiling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Polyomino</h4>
                <p>A <strong>polyomino</strong> is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Symmetry</h4>
                <p><strong>Symmetry</strong> in mathematics refers to a transformation that leaves an object looking the same after it has been applied. For tilings, symmetries include rotations, reflections, and translations that map the tiling onto itself.</p>
                <p><strong>Example of Symmetry:</strong> A square has 4-fold rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated by 90 degrees and still look the same.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Boundary Word</h4>
                <p>A <strong>boundary word</strong> is a sequence that represents the directions taken when traversing the perimeter of a tile. For this project, we will read the boundary words starting from the top left corner (an arbitrary choice) and proceed in a clockwise direction. The boundary word is composed of the letters representing the four cardinal directions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>R</strong> (Right)</li>
                    <li><strong>U</strong> (Up)</li>
                    <li><strong>L</strong> (Left)</li>
                    <li><strong>D</strong> (Down)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a simple rectangle tile. Starting from the top left corner and moving clockwise, its boundary word could be represented as "rrrdlllu".</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Period</h4>
                <p>A <strong>period</strong> of a word \( W \) is the smallest positive integer \( p \) such that \( W[i] = W[i + p] \) for all valid \( i \).</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> In the word "ababab", the smallest period is 2, since the pattern "ab" repeats.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Palindrome</h4>
                <p>A <strong>palindrome</strong> is a word or sequence that reads the same forward and backward. In the context of boundary words, a palindrome indicates reflective symmetry along an axis.</p>
                <p><strong>Example of a Palindrome:</strong> The word "dduudd" is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.</p>
                <p><strong>Formally:</strong> A word \( W \) of length \( n \) is a palindrome if \( W[i] = W[n - i + 1] \) for all \( i \) from \( 1 \) to \( n \).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Θ-Drome</h4>
                <p>A <strong>Θ-drome</strong> is a generalization of palindromes for rotational symmetries. It is a word that is symmetric under rotation by an angle \( \theta \) degrees.</p>
                <p>A word \( X \) is a \( \theta \)-drome if it can be written in the form:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    \[
                    X = Y \cdot t_{\theta + 180}(\widetilde{Y})
                    \]
                </blockquote>
                <p><strong>Example of a 90-drome:</strong> Consider the boundary word "rurd", it is a 90-drome because 'urrddr' = \( Y \cdot t_{90+180}({\widetilde{Y}}) \) with \( Y \) = "urr".</p>
            </div>

            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Admissibility</h4>
                <p>An <strong>admissible factor</strong> is a substring \( X \) of the boundary word \( W \) that satisfies one of the following conditions, ensuring it can be part of a valid quarter-turn factorization:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Θ-drome:</strong>

                            <li><em>Definition:</em> A word \( X \) is a Θ-drome if \( X = Y \cdot ( t_{\Theta+180}\{\widetilde{Y}\} \)), where \( {\widetilde{Y}} \) is the end segment of \( Y \), and \( t_{\Theta+180} \) represents a transformation combining a Θ-degree rotation with a 180-degree rotation.</li>
                            <li><em>Admissibility Condition:</em> \( W = XU \) with \( U[-1] \neq t_{\Theta+180}(U)[1] \).</li>

            <h2 id="symmetries">Symmetries in Tilings</h2>
        
            <p>Here, we focus on identifying isohedral tiles characterized by 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetries. The specific polygons considered are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polyiamonds:</strong> Built from equilateral triangles, exhibiting 3-fold rotational symmetry.</li>
                <li><strong>Polyominoes:</strong> Composed of squares, displaying 4-fold rotational symmetry.</li>
                <li><strong>Polyhexes:</strong> Made from regular hexagons, allowing for 3-fold and 6-fold rotational symmetries.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3 >Using the Quarter-Turn Factorization Algorithm for Rotational Symmetries</h3>
            <p>The <strong>quarter-turn factorization algorithm</strong>, described below, is not limited to detecting 4-fold rotational symmetry. By adjusting the parameter \( \Theta \) (the rotation angle), the same algorithm can be applied to identify other rotational symmetries in boundary words. The algorithm works as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For 3-fold rotational symmetry:</strong> Set \( \Theta = 120° \).</li>
                <li><strong>For 4-fold rotational symmetry:</strong> Set \( \Theta = 90° \) (default case in the algorithm).</li>
                <li><strong>For 6-fold rotational symmetry:</strong> Set \( \Theta = 60° \).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The logic of the algorithm remains consistent across these symmetries. It identifies admissible factors such as palindromes and \( \Theta \)-dromes, preprocesses them, and verifies potential tiling configurations.</p>
        
            <h3>Quarter-Turn Factorization in Boundary Words</h3>
            <p>In the study of polyominoes and their tiling properties, understanding the symmetries of their boundary words is crucial. This section provides a comprehensive explanation of an algorithm for detecting quarter-turn factorizations in boundary words of polyominoes. We will define key concepts, present important lemmas with proofs, and explain the algorithm in a didactic manner, ensuring clarity and accessibility.</p>
        
            <div class="definition">
                <h4>Definition: Quarter-Turn Factorization</h4>
                <p>A <strong>quarter-turn factorization</strong> of a boundary word \( W \) is a factorization of the form <strong>\( W = ABC \)</strong>, where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A</strong> is a palindrome.</li>
                    <li><strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are 90-dromes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This factorization helps identify 4-fold rotational symmetries in polyominoes.</p>
            </div>
        
            <h4>Example of Quarter-Turn Factorization</h4>
            <p>Consider the boundary word <strong>W = "uurruudurdrlrlud"</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A = "uurruu"</strong> &mdash; This is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.</li>
                <li><strong>B = "durdrl"</strong> &mdash; This is a 90-drome. Applying the rotation for a 90-drome:
                    <ul>
                        <li>\( t_{90+180}(u) = r \)</li>
                        <li>\( t_{90+180}(d) = l \)</li>
                        <li>\( t_{90+180}(l) = u \)</li>
                        <li>\( t_{90+180}(r) = d \)</li>
                    </ul>
                    We get for the first part of B "durl" : "lrd" which we reverse to get the 90-drome: <strong>"drl"</strong>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>C = "rlud"</strong> &mdash; Similarly, <strong>C</strong> is a 90-drome by the same reasoning as <strong>B</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Therefore, <strong>W = A + B + C = "uurruu" + "durdrl" + "rlud"</strong> is a valid quarter-turn factorization.</p>
        
            <p>Here is an illustration example below using the word.</p>

            <h3>Lemmas and Proofs</h3>
        
            <p>To understand and develop the algorithm for detecting quarter-turn factorizations, we rely on several important lemmas. These lemmas help establish the properties of palindromes and 90-dromes within boundary words.</p>
        
            <div class="lemma">
                <h4>Lemma 4.12 (Theorem 9.1.1 of [1])</h4>
                <p>Two circular words \( X \) and \( Y \) can be preprocessed in \( O(|X| + |Y|) \) time to support the following queries in \( O(1) \) time: What is the longest common factor of \( X \) and \( Y \) starting at \( X[i] \) and \( Y[j] \)?</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma provides an efficient method to preprocess two circular words, enabling constant-time queries to determine the longest common substring starting at specified positions within each word. This capability is crucial for optimizing algorithms that require frequent and rapid comparisons of word segments, such as those involved in pattern matching or factorization processes.</p>
            </div>
        
            <!-- Lemma 1 -->
            <div class="lemma">
                <h4>Lemma 5.1</h4>
                <p>Let \( W \) be a word with a period \( p \), and \( X \) a 90-drome subword of \( W \). Then we have \( |X| \leq p \).</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a word that repeats every \( p \) characters, any 90-drome within it cannot be longer than \( p \). This is because the symmetry imposed by the 90-drome cannot extend beyond the repeating pattern of the word.</p>
            </div>
        
            <!-- Lemma 2 -->
            <div class="lemma">
                <h4>Lemma 5.2</h4>
                <p>Let \( W \) be a word. Let \( P \) be a prefix and \( S \) be a suffix of \( W \), both being distinct 90-dromes with \( |P|, |S| \geq \frac{2}{3}|W| \). Then any other 90-drome factor of \( W \) not sharing the center with \( P \) or \( S \) has length less than \( 2|W| - (|P| + |S|) \).</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma limits the length of any additional 90-drome in \( W \) that doesn't overlap with the centers of \( P \) or \( S \). Essentially, large 90-dromes consume much of the word's length, restricting the size of other non-overlapping 90-dromes.</p>
            </div>
        
            <!-- Lemma 3 -->

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> If there are two 90-drome prefixes with different lengths, the shorter one cannot be too long. This is due to the limitations imposed by the presence of the longer 90-drome on the structure of the word.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma states that only a constant number of long 90-dromes can exist in \( W \). This is important for the efficiency of our algorithm, as it limits the number of candidates we need to consider.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The overlapping structure of long palindromic prefixes and suffixes imposes a periodic pattern on the word \( W \).</p>

                <p>Under the same conditions as Lemma 5, any admissible middle palindrome of \( W \) has length at most \( 2|W| - (|P| + |S|) \).</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Middle palindromes not overlapping with the long palindromic prefix or suffix must be short due to the periodicity imposed by the longer palindromes.</p>
            </div>
        
            <!-- Lemma 7 -->
            <div class="lemma">

                <p>Let \( W \) be a word. There exists an \( O(1) \)-sized set \( F \) of factors of \( W \) such that every admissible palindrome factor with length at least \( \frac{|W|}{3} \) is an affix (prefix or suffix) of an element of \( F \). \( F \) is computable in \( O(|W|) \) time.</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> All long palindromic factors are associated with a small, computable set. This allows us to efficiently identify and consider all significant palindromic factors.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This lemma confirms that the factors in the quarter-turn factorization meet the necessary conditions to be considered palindromes and 90-dromes within the boundary word.</p>

            <p>The algorithm efficiently determines whether a boundary word \( W \) of a polyomino \( P \) possesses a valid quarter-turn factorization by systematically preprocessing admissible factors, leveraging the pigeonhole principle, and combining factors based on established lemmas. The use of Lemma 4.12 for preprocessing ensures rapid identification of maximal factors, while Lemmas 5.3, 5.4, and 5.8 guide the combination and verification processes, maintaining overall linear time complexity.</p>
